---

Well being is the most important criteria for the existence of any living creature. How healthy we are matters a lot to our living and in turn affects every part of our daily activities. Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. According to World Health Organization (WHO), 1948, health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental and social well being and not just mere absence of disease. It is not only the absence of disease that makes you healthy, far beyond this. You are healthy when you are in a good condition physically, mentally and socially, anything less than this is termed as being Unhealthy.

\*\*Physical Health\*\* defines the physical fitness of the body. It is dependent on genetic determinators and also on social, economic and ecological factors. That means, one´s genes are partly responsible for one´s physical health, but also other circumstances: where you live, how clean or polluted your water and the air around you is and also how good your social and medical system is. It is also the result of regular exercise, proper diet and nutrition, and proper rest for physical recovery. Physical unhealthiness refers to the presence of sickness, disease, disorder or defective conditions in the body, and this affects the physical and Metabolic functionality and productivity of the organism.  
\*\*Mental Health\*\* defines a person’s emotional and psychological well-being. It refers to being able to use your emotional ability to carry out everyday activities. Mental unhealthiness is accompanied with the presence of neurological and psychological defective conditions. It can be caused due to disorder in the neural system causing malfunctioning or maltransmission of neurologic signals. Mental unhealthiness can also be due to psychological manipulations. Human emotions alter reactions in the body through the endocrine (hormones) or neural system. In reference to this, addiction is also known to be under this category of unhealthiness.  
\*\*Social Health\*\* defines man and his environment. As Humans, we relate to the environment and our environment relate to us. It is therefore important to have a well and stable surroundings. Social health involves how people live with one another and their relationship as friends or family, at home, school or work. In considering these three factors, we are good to create a well stable and complete human by adjusting to a fit lifestyle. \*\*\*A man’s health is determined by two categories of factors:\*\*\* - \*Uncontrollable Factor\* - the Gene defines the structurality and functionality of man. Therefore the genetic coding of a man determines the behavioural configuration of the man just as a program coding determines the fuctional configuration of a computer. This factor is inevitable (congenital) and cannot be consciously manipulated. - \*Controllable factors\* - Habitual lifestyle determines the level of human functionality. The way we live reflects our Health Status. How we live in yesterday, determines who we are today. This factor can be consciously manipulated. Therefore how we choose live today determines how healthy we are going to become. The way we live, where we live, how we relate, our habits, how we cope with stress and what we live on all matters to our well being. ### Healthy lifestyle Habits  
\*\*\*Dietary Habits\*\*\*: Eating a healthy, balanced diet plays an essential role in maintaining a healthy body, which is an important part of overall good health. Eat a wide range of foods to ensure that you're getting a balanced diet and that your body is receiving all the nutrients it needs.
